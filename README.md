# Robust-semiparametric-efficient-R-estimator-for-shape-matrices
This repository contains the code that implements the R-estimator of shape matrices in CES distributions corresponding to https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02239. In this code a van der Waerden score function is used to evaluate the rank-based approximation of the central sequence.
